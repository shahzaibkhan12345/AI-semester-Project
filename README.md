Stock Price Prediction with Transformer Model
This repository explores the use of a Transformer model for stock price prediction. Transformers have shown promising results in various sequence prediction tasks, making them well-suited for analyzing financial time series data.

This implementation leverages the Transformer architecture's ability to capture long-range dependencies within stock price data.

The code provides a framework for training and evaluating a Transformer-based model for stock price forecasting.

Here are steps to run the code:

Open Google Colab
Download Transfromer(10_Companies).ipynb and data of 10 stocks
Open the file in Colab
Upload 10 stocks files into Colab
Run the code
